# Week 1
1. Introduced the mentees with Competitive Programming and various platforms to practice such as Codeforces, Codechef etc
2. Installing and integrating VS-Code and some of its useful extensions
3. Covered time and space complexity and the need to write efficient code
4. Introduction to C++ and Standard Template Library of C++
5. Organised mashup-contests based on STL algorithms and data structures

# Week 2
In this week, the mentees were taught various searching and sorting algorithms and were asked to implement some of them. Topics such as binary search were covered in detail beyond the trivial use of searching an element in a sorted list. Furthermore, topics such as Binary Exponentiation and modular arithmetic were covered. A mashup contest based on the above concepts was also organised.
